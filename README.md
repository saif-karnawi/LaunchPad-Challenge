# LaunchPad-Challenge

Frontend Web
You and your friends are developing a new start-up called DRUBER, a drone-based ride share application that carries you to your destination. 
The original specification was to develop a web page that works in 1920x1080 however your company has realized that it is missing an entire 
market of smartphone users. Describe how you can modify your code to work in smartphone resolutions e.g. 750x1334 (iPhone 8).
Please give specific examples where possible, but do not implement an entire DRUBER clone!
